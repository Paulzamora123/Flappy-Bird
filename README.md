# Flappy-Bird

  This is the final project I completed for my Google sponsored Computer Science Computing Initiative (CSSI). I collaborated with another partner on this assignment and her name is Yulisa Garcia. We used the p5 javascript library to help integrate sound and collision properties into our Flappy Bird game. 

  In the game, The user can use either the mouse or the keyboard to make the bird fly. As you progress through the game, you collect coins which are used to add toppings towards the character. Note. While in the shop, you can simply exit by pressing r to reset the game. There is also a high score feature to keep track of your best run.
  
  If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.
